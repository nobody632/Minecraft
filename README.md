# Minecraft
I just tried to make it easier for you to play minecraft because I know it can be quite complicated. There are two options for playing it:
Option 1. Navigate to index.html and click download on the right hand side, then open it in your browser.
Option 2. If you don't understand, you can use the online site: https://nobody632.github.io/Minecraft/
